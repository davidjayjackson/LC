# Title: Analyzing Light Curves, A Practial Guide
## Author: Grant Foster
### Library creater: David Jackson
### Install: devtools::install_github("davidjayjackson/LC")
### R scripts and data for book: https://github.com/davidjayjackson/LC-Demo

### List of functions to assist in the analyzing of light curves of variable stars.

#### Function list:
* anova1 == Anova1 1-way ANOVA
* aovper == Period search by Analysis of Variance
* dcdft == date-compensated discrete Fourier transform
* findstart == find starting index of a particular value
* foldit == fold a light curve with a trial period
* fourfit == fit a Fourier series
* movave == compute a moving average
* peak1 == find the main peak (only) in DCDFT or AoVper
* timave == time-based averaging

### Apply ANOVA test to data based on a single categorical (factor) variable.

#### anova1(x,fac,sort=F,progress=F)

* x           dependent variable (to be tested for dependence)
* fac         factor on which the dependent variable may depend
            Note: if the variable is numeric, then it is
            converted to catagorical (a factor) for the test
* sort        if TRUE, then the output is sorted into descending
            order of the number of occurences of each factor
* progress    if TRUE, a graph is displayed showing the progress
            of the computation
            
#### Example:

#### anova1(mag,floor(t/10))   

test for changes in "mag" dependent on floor(t/10) as a categorical (rather than numerical) variable.  This is quivalent to using 10-day wide bins
                                
#### anova1(mag,obs)    
test for changes in "mag" dependent on the variable "obs" -- which might be observer I.D.  In this case it's OK
if "obs" is a string variable -- since the anova1 routine converts the variable to a factor anyway, numeric
variables are treated the same as non-numerics.

            If these are given, and the periodogram is a DCDFT
            rather than AoV periodogram, then standard errors are
            computed for the peak frequency and (semi-)amplitude

peak1(dcd)                      # find the strongest peak in the
                                # object "dcd" and the upper and lower

lofre       lowest frequency to include
hifre       highest frequency to include
maxpeak     maximum number of peaks to report.  If specified,
            only this many strongest peaks will be returned
plot        if TRUE, a plot is made of the observed chi-square
            values of the peaks vs the theoretical chi-square
            peak values (based on treating peaks as chi-square
            with 3 degrees of freedom)

Examples:

dcd = dcdft(t,x,0,.01)          # compute the DCDFT of (t,x) for
                                # frequencies from 0 to 0.01, and
                                # assign it to an object called "dcd"
peaks(dcd)                      # find all the peaks in the periodogram
                                # saved as "dcd"
pp = peaks(dcd)                 # find all the peaks in the periodogram
                                # saved as "dcd" and store them in an

x           vector of data values
t2ave       width of time spans over which to average.  If not
            specified, the width defaults to 1 time unit
t.off       time offset.  Normally, time bins start at zero, but
            if t.off is specified they start at t.off
n.min       minimum number of data points required for a given bin
wide        width of error bars (in units of the standard error)
plot        if TRUE, a plot of the averages, with error bars, is created

            only points are plotted
tit         title to be used for the plot
big         if TRUE, then on the plot those values that are
            significantly different from the overall mean are
            circled in red, those which are more than 2.5 standard
            deviations from the overall mean (whether significant
            or not) are circled in blue

Examples:

timave(t,x,10)                  # average the time series (t,x)
                                # using 10-day wide time bins
                                # and plot the result.  Note: this
                                # plot uses a "normal" (not inverted)
                                # y-axis, so it's "upside-down" when
                                # the "x" variable is magnitude
q = timave(t,x,10)              # average the time series (t,10)
                                # using 10-day wide time bins
                                # and store the result in an object
                                # called "q"
